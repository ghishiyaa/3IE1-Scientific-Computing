##In this file I will be learning to do a series of formatting methods using Mark down 

##First level header
## This is how you make a first level header (use ## at start of text)

#Second level header 
#This is how you create a second level header (use # at the start of text)

We can make subsequent level headers by decreasing (lowering header level)/ increasing (increasing header level) the number of #'s

#How to bold/ italicize text 
Text will be bolded if an # is added at the start of the text 

##Lists:
#Bulleted List:
Here is an example of a bulleted list:
- apples
- bananas
- grapes
- peaches

#Ordered List:
Here is an example of an ordered list:
1. First
2. Second 
3. Third
4. Fourth
