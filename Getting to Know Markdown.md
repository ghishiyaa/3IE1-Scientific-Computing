# In this file I will be learning to do a series of formatting methods using Mark down 

#### First level header
# This is how you make a first level header (use # at start of text)

#### Second level header 
## This is how you create a second level header (use ## at the start of text)

#### n level header
if n=3;
### This would be how you create a third level header (### at starts of text)

# How to bold/ italicize text 
Text will be bolded if an # is added at the start of the text
